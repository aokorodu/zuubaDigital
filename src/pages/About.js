      I am an interactive developer with over 15 years of experience developing
      interactive animations, animated infographics, high-fidelity prototypes,
      websites, games, and applications. The types of environments in which I
      have worked are quite varied - from large, fast-paced interactive ad
      agencies to medium-sized technology companies and small start-ups. I have
      had the ability at each stop along the way to quickly adapt to changing
      and evolving technologies and to learn new skills.
